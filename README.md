# react-native-wearables

A React Native module with a common interface for interacting with wearables on iOS and Android.

### Getting started

Install react-native-wearables.
`npm install react-native-wearables`

Install the peer dependencies.
`npm install rn-apple-healthkit react-native-google-fitness`

Link the native modules.
`react-native link`

Edit `android/app/src/main/java/.../MainApplication.java`. The line that looks like `new GoogleFitPackage()` should be changed to `new GoogleFitPackage(BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID)`.

### Demo app

Go to [yldio/react-native-wearables-demo](https://github.com/yldio/react-native-wearables-demo) to check out a super simple demo app that runs on both iOS and Android.

## Data

`Data` is a common interface to the health and fitness data system repositories on iOS and Android, respective HealthKit and Google Fitness.

It lets you write code like this which works on both iOS and Android.

```js
import { Data } from "react-native-wearables";

Data.authorize([Data.Types.heartRateBpm])
  .then(() =>
    Data.read(Data.Types.heartRateBpm, {
      startDate: new Date("2018-05-01"),
      endDate: new Date("2018-05-09")
    })
  )
  .then(samples => console.log(samples))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Motivation

This project builds on the great work of existing iOS- and Android-specific React Native modules to access wearables data on each platform. It abstracts the platform differences into a common interface that makes it easy to create great cross-platform experiences with wearables data.

### API Documentation

#### `Data.Types`

An object of constants representing each of the data types supported by the module.

* `Data.Types.heartRateBpm`, heart rate samples, unit is BPM (beats per minute)

#### `Data.authorize(dataTypes)`

Launches the OS-specific dialog to request permission from the user to read / write the data types requested.

##### Example

```js
import { Data } from "react-native-wearables";

Data.authorize([Data.Types.heartRateBpm])
  .then(() => console.log("permission granted"))
  .catch(() => console.log("permission not granted"));
```

##### Arguments

* `dataTypes`, an array of data types constants, found in `Data.Types`.

##### Returns

A promise which resolves when and if the user granted the requested permission to your app and rejects if the user cancelled or didnâ€™t grant permission.

#### `Data.read(dataType, options)`

Retrieves data samples from HealthKit on iOS and Google Fitness on Android. Will fail if called before `Data.authorize` has been called with success.

##### Arguments

* `dataType`, a data type, found in `Data.Types`
* `options`, an object of options - `startDate`, a `Date` instance - `endDate`, a `Date` instance

##### Returns

An array of data points, where

* `value` is a number
* `startDate` is a Date ISO string
* `endDate` is a Date ISO string

```js
[
	{
		value: 80,
		startDate: "2018-06-06T13:59:47.375+0100",
		endDate: "2018-06-06T13:59:47.375+0100",
	},
	...
]
```
